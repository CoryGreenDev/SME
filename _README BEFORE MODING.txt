So you want to create a Multiplayer server or modify the engine?

Well you will be pleased that it will include no coding or basic coding in order to do whatever you want!

There is no VAC for 'Create a Server' so you can load in any addons and people can play that server with the specified addons.
Basically making it SUPER easy for complex servers!

If you want VAC I will provide a decatided server link and teach you to launch it with a tutorial, but thats in the future.
If you want to have better maps or *guns, just drag and drop files.

The game is just a multiplayer engine for people to make *EASY servers.

There is 2 maps not created by me but you can play it with freinds.
Those maps are very glitchy and the second one REQUIRES for you to use No Clip in certian areas.

~Games that are not offically hosted as an decatided server is not secure, hackers might lurk.

But never the less,

Enjoy the game!

*High quality guns & player models require a high amount of video memory which WILL crash most games.
*Servers can only either be hosted using scrds or 'Create a Server'. There is no security either. There is not hosting
sites unless you use a VPS (Which is what hosting sites do so, you could)
